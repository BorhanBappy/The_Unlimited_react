# State

## What is State ?

- Data that a component can hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle.
- " Components memory"
- Component State: Single local component variable ("Piece of State", "State variable")
- Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component.


## THE "THINKING IN REACT" PROCESS:


### Not a rigid process
#### Break the desired UI into components and establish the component tree
#### Build a static version in React (without state)

###  State management
#### Think about state:
- When to use state
- Types of state: local vs. global
- Where to place each piece of state â– 

### Establish data flow:
- One-way data flow
- Child-to-parent communication
- Accessing global state
